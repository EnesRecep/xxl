{"name":"XXL","tagline":"The eXtensible and fleXible Library XXL for Java","body":"# XXL\r\nThe eXtensible and fleXible Library XXL is a Java library that contains a rich infrastructure for implementing advanced query processing functionality.\r\nThe library offers low-level components like access to raw disks as well as high-level ones like a query optimizer.\r\nOn the intermediate levels, XXL provides a demand-driven cursor algebra, a framework for indexing and a powerful package for supporting aggregation.\r\nThe XXL project provides various packages.\r\nSee the longer introduction to XXL for an explanation of the packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main Features\r\n+ A demand-driven cursor algebra including efficient implementations of object-relational operators such as joins, difference, MergeSort etc.\r\n+ An extended relational algebra based on java.sql.ResultSet\r\n+ A powerful framework of index-structures, e.g. B+tree, R-tree (linear and quadratic split Guttman et al), R\\*tree, RR\\*tree, \r\nHilbert R-tree, R-tree (linear split Tan et al), X-tree, M-tree etc.\r\n+ A framework for processing multi-way joins including spatial, temporal, and similarity joins\r\n+ The support of raw-I/O (using JNI), an own file system implementation, and a record manager\r\n+ Skyline query R-tree extension\r\n+ MVBT (Multiversion B+Tree)-Index Implementation\r\n+ MVBT+ bulk-loading approach\r\n+ Sort-based bulk-loading methods for R-trees (including STR and GOPT approach)\r\n+ Top-down buffer tree bulk-loading of R-trees\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building\r\nYou can add the XXL library into your local maven repository by calling `mvn install -DskipTests`.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to generate jar files you can execute `mvn package`.\r\nYou should find the output files in the *target* directory.\r\n\r\nIn order to just generate JavaDoc you can execute `mvn javadoc:javadoc`.\r\nThe *target* directory should now contain the JavaDoc HTML pages.\r\n\r\nTo execute the tests you can call `mvn test`.\r\nNow maven will run all testNG testcases for XXL.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using\r\nAll classes of XXL are documented in detail, containing examples in the JavaDoc.\r\nYou can also look at the test cases how the different data structures were used there.\r\nAdditionally, you can find use cases separately in [xxl-usecases](http://github.com/umr-dbs/xxl-usecases) that simplify their understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Papers\r\n* Michael Cammert, Christoph Heinz, Jürgen Krämer, Martin Schneider, Bernhard Seeger: <br />\r\n[**A Status Report on XXL - a Software Infrastructure for Efficient Query Processing.**](http://dbs.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/publications/myPapers/2003/CHKSS03.pdf) IEEE Data Eng.
